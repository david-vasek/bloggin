# Week two at DigitalCrafts
Time really seems like it is flying by already. Week two has already come to an end and we are finishing up our Python projects as I type this. 
An even larger information load was dumped on us this week and it was definitely a lot to take in. I still am a little confident-lacking in some areas involving some of the information but overall I think i was really able to incorporate what we learned into our projects. 

# Upcoming Week Preparation 
I think i need to really focus on preparing a lot more on future topics and looking at the new information before it is presented to me. I think that will help me have a better understanding of all of it as Sean is teaching it to us.
