# Week two at DigitalCrafts
Time really seems like it is flying already. Week two has already come to an end and we are finishing up our Python projects as I type this. 
An even larger information load was dumped on us this week and it was definitely a lot to take in. I still am a little confident-lacking in some of the information but overall I thinked i was really able to incorporate what we learned into our projects.
