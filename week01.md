# My First Week at DigitalCrafts
Hello all who stumble upon this and give it a read! 
# About me
My name is David Vasek and i am currently a student at DigitalCrafts. I recently enrolled in a Full-stack developer bootcamp in hopes of starting a career in the tech world. I have always been interested in how things work/are created. Thats why technology has always been an interest of mine and i finally took the leap into this new field. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2019 in pursuit of a career in the medical field. As time passed while at UT, my passion for medicine started to disappear. I always choose the computer sciecne building to study and found myself watching the other students more than actually studying for my own classes. I soon befriended a few people who introduced me to all the different things involved in web development. Before I knew it, I was playing around with Python more than actually studying for the MCAT. 
# Week One 
Week one was daunting at first. We were hit with a massive amount of information and it seemed like too much to take in all at once. Fortunately, we have an amazing instructor (Sean) and two awesome TA's (Sam and Zach). They helped break down all of the information, line by line, to really help us understand it.
Week one topics included:
    1. The command line
    2. understanding and navigating through github
    3. Python
    4. Being taught to just have fun and relax. This is an awesome field to work in  but sometimes you need to walk away and come back at it with a fresh mindset.

Overall, the first week was amazing and I cannot believe i finally took the first steps towards my future career field.
